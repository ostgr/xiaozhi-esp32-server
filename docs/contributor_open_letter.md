# Open Letter to Developers

"The ducks are the first to know when the spring river warms, just when the pufferfish are about to swim upstream!"

Dear friend, I'm John, an ordinary Java programmer in a regular company. Today, with the most sincere feelings, I'm sending this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects like `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other artificial intelligence related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects, but unfortunately "I have no way to serve my country, having coded in vain for ten years."

I came across Brother Xia's team's videos in early 2025, and I was very curious about how they implemented it. I wanted to replicate their backend service and create a low-cost civilian JARVIS. Unfortunately, what I've made now is still just artificial stupidity - low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

Brother Xia's team is our learning target. I really want to have a Xiaozhi backend service as intelligent as Brother Xia's team. But I can also understand Brother Xia's decision not to open source. "A single flower blooming is not spring, but a hundred flowers blooming fills the garden with spring." The era when artificial intelligence blooms everywhere might be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to achieve low-cost civilian JARVIS. I personally believe that what they can achieve, we can also achieve - it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to obtain the scriptures."

So on this journey to obtain the scriptures, what difficulties will we encounter? I think there will be no fewer than eighty-one trials. Along this path, various demons will inevitably appear, but of course there will also be immortals secretly helping us, and people joining our scripture-seeking team.

If you find the above content funny, then I also feel very fortunate. Being able to make you laugh for five seconds in your life of more than 30,000 days is also a contribution I've made to you.

Will this idea of civilian low-cost JARVIS fail? I don't know, but isn't this kind of failure very common in the lives of us ordinary people?

One thing is certain about the future: someone will definitely completely replicate Brother Xia's team's functionality and achieve civilian low-cost JARVIS. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to moving forward hand in hand with you, creating the future together.

# Appendix: Development Contribution Guide

## Project Goals

1. **Civilian Low-Cost JARVIS Solution**  

2. **Smart Interconnection with Peripheral Hardware Solution**  

## Join Us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join and contribute to the project together. You can check the features we plan to implement recently at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). Features in the list that haven't been assigned to anyone are exactly what urgently need your participation. Participation methods are as follows:

### 1. Become a Regular Contributor

Fork the project, submit PR, and after developer review, merge into the main branch.

### 2. Become a Developer

After you have submitted 3 valid PRs cumulatively, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join an independent developer group to discuss the project's future together.

## Developer Development Process

1. **Create New Branch**  
   Please develop each feature point as a new branch. Branch names should be concise and clear, allowing people to see the implemented functionality at a glance, avoiding feature conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for Review**  
   After feature development is complete, please submit PR on GitHub for review by other developers. After review approval, merge into the main branch.
